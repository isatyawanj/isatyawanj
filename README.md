- 👋 Hi, I’m Satyawan Jangra
- 👀 I’m interested in each project and tools in infrastructure provisioning, IaC, compute, storage, networks to help in building telco grade cloud native solutions. 
- 🌱 I’m currently having experience in ansible, python, kubernetes, docker, openstack, ceph, rancher, servers, storage, and still exploring in more depth.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various open source projects. 
- 📫 Thanks
